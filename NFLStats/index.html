<!--
    todo:
    use query time for progress or spinner?
    use map/reduce for stats
    maybe have two sub controllers
    --chart or charts
    --grid
    when dropdown is changed, variious sub controllers get messaged about it and do their thing


The goal of the project is to create a visual and interactive display for an MLB batter's or NFL
quarterback's performance over time.
• For the NFL data set, we're interested in seeing two derived rate stats (Yd/Att and Cmp%)
displayed over time for each quarterback. We are also interested in seeing some of the
counting stats (some of which are used to calculate the rate stats) displayed in the UI as well. In
the JSON data, we provide: Att, Cmp, Sack, Int, PsYds, PsTD, Rush, RshYds, and RshTD.

• You do not need to create a comparison UI, it's sufficient for this project to display the data
for each batter or each quarterback one at a time on separate pages.
