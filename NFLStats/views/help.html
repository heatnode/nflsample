        <h3>General Info</h3>
        <p>
            Hopefully the sample application is fairly self-explanatory. Here are a few notes:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You should see 2 or 3 drop-downs at the top depending on whether you've selected
                        a chart based on one year or all years.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The application is based on the idea of starting at a high level (years) and being able to uncover
                        more detail by drilling down.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Note that you can click on the yearly level bar charts to get to the weekly level.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on "QB Performance" or "Home" will essentially reset the application.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The application is somewhat responsive friendly. It should render in a decent way even on a small device. You can resize
                        your browser window to a very small size to see the effect.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I tested in current versions of Chrome and Internet Explorer. Should be fine in any modern-ish browser. IE8 not supported. :)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
